# Cloud Native Progressive Web Apps with Spring Boot and Angular

**Prerequisites:** [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running the Project

Clone this project, start each Spring Boot app, then start the Angular client.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mraible/cloud-native-pwas.git
cd cloud-native-pwas
cd kolin-reactive # or kotlin-basic
```

To run the client and all the servers, execute `./run.sh`, or execute the [commands in this file](https://github.com/mraible/cloud-native-pwas/blob/master/kotlin-reactive/run.sh) manually.

## Deploy to Cloud Foundry

To deploy this application stack on Cloud Foundry with [Pivotal Web Services](http://run.pivotal.io/), youâ€™ll need to create an account, download/install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and sign-in (using `cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io`).

Both `kotlin-reactive` and `kotlin-basic` contain a `deploy.sh` script that you can run to deploy all four applications and configure them to work with each other.

Running [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) on `kotlin-reactive` after it's deployed show it gets ðŸ’¯ as a PWA!

## Security with Okta

To see how to lock things down with Okta, see the `okta` branch and [this PR](https://github.com/mraible/cloud-native-pwas/pull/10).

> **NOTE:** This only works with the `kotlin-basic` project. Okta's Spring Boot Starter [doesn't work with Spring Cloud Gateway](https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/24).
